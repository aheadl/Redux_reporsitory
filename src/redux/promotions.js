//????  change the comments and promotions reducer files to no longer use the data from the files in the 
//????   shared folder, but to use the data that's fetched from the server and dispatched to the reducer as 
//????   action payloads instead. 
//????    it is no longer a simple array, but an object that contains the comments or promotions array as a property, 
//????    plus other properties (errMess for comments, errMess and isLoading for promotions).
